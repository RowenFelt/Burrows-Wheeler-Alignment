Make evaluation code first
evaluate as you go/evaluate for each optimization
	
compile table of optimizations and evaluations
	mention linear space
	do timing on different kinds of reads

statistics to gather:
	try the following for 0,1,2,3 mismatches:
		how many reads matched to the genome
		how many matched to the correct position
		What is the average number of matches for each read

	could also show pigeonhole principle by carving reads up into kmers with len/k reads
		test above examples

reading the input
	4th is position
	6th is cigar string
		can have insertions or deletions (these will not map)
		can compare unmapped strings to insertions and deletions
