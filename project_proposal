My plan for the final project is to implement the Burrows-Wheeler Transform Alignment algorithm. I plan to apply the algorithm to aligning sequencing reads to the genome of Prochlorococcus marinus, a strain of photosynthetic autotroph Prochlorococcus (full genome at https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/pro_2/pro_2.home.html). I will compare the performance of my implementation using synthetic reads from the complete genome and experimental reads from a real dataset (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR7647499).
