Final Project for Bioinformatic Algorithms

This is an implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Algorithm.

Run my experiments by running the ```experiment.sh``` script.

You can view my experimental setup in ```setup_experiment```.

My unit tests are in ```bwt_tests.py``` and the BWA querying code is in ```bwt_query.py```.
